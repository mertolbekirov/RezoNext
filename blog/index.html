                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a powerful tool that can significantly boost the visibility of your website. To fully harness its potential, there are several fundamental aspects you should know and apply. Let's explore the top seven things to start with when diving into SEO.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Keyword Research</h2>
                <p>Keywords are the backbone of SEO. They are the terms and phrases that users type into search engines when looking for information. Thorough keyword research will help you understand what your potential visitors are searching for and enable you to tailor your content to their needs. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Ahrefs can be instrumental in this process.</p>
                
                <h2>2. On-Page SEO</h2>
                <p>On-Page SEO involves optimizing individual pages on your site to rank higher and attract more relevant traffic. This process includes optimizing your content and HTML tags. Content should be high-quality, original, and provide value to your visitors. HTML tags, such as title tags and meta descriptions, should include your target keywords whenever appropriate.</p>

                <h2>3. Technical SEO</h2>
                <p>Technical SEO relates to non-content elements of your website. It includes strategies to improve a site's backend structure and foundation. Aspects like site speed, mobile optimization, crawlability, security, and indexing fall under this umbrella. An efficiently indexed and crawlable site makes it easy for search engines to understand and rank.</p>
                
                <h2>4. User Experience</h2>
                <p>Search engines like Google aim to provide users with the most relevant and high-quality results. A big part of this is the overall user experience on your site. Things like site navigation, site speed, mobile usability, and content readability all contribute to a better user experience and thus, better SEO.</p>

                <h2>5. Link Building</h2>
                <p>Links are a crucial factor in how search engines rank websites. Having a network of high-quality and relevant inbound and outbound links can significantly boost your site's authority and ranking. Remember, quality trumps quantity when it comes to link building.</p>

                <h2>6. Content Creation</h2>
                <p>Creating engaging, high-quality content is key for SEO. Useful and relevant content draws in visitors, keeps them on your site longer, and encourages them to share your content on social media and other platforms. It's essential to regularly produce fresh content that caters to your audience's needs and interests.</p>

                <h2>7. Tracking and Analytics</h2>
                <p>Without tracking and analytics, it's impossible to know if your SEO efforts are paying off. Using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can provide valuable insights into your site's traffic, visitor behavior, and other important metrics. By analyzing this data, you can make informed decisions to further optimize your SEO strategies.</p>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Starting with SEO can seem overwhelming, but focusing on these seven areas can set a solid foundation. Remember, SEO is a long-term commitment that requires patience and consistency. With time and effort, it can significantly increase your online visibility and drive more organic traffic to your site.</p>
